## What I do

- Get a diff from origin to see all the changes that's been made from the last push
- Review the code thoroughly and find issues in: code quality, best practices, performance, potential bugs, accessibility breaches, unnecesssary repetition of code, wrong spacing or indentation, unrelated or unused code, unnecessary redundancy.
